# Overview of the Game
Left Behind is a first-person zombie shooting game inspired by the game series Left 4 Dead. The player takes place as a guy exploring an abandoned village, that happens to have been overrun by zombies. It's the middle of the night, so you need to use your flashlight to get a reliable look of your surroundings. You gotta be fast or the zombies might sneak up on you. Survive wave after wave and gather enough points to beat your friend's high score.

The main parts of the game are:
* Player: Move around an empty village and shoot hordes of zombies coming at you
* Gun: Use your gun to shoot and kill zombies
* Flashlight: Your surroundings are dark, so you need to rely on your flashlight to see incoming zombies

* An abandoned village you can run around to run from the zombies
